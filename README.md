# Pokemon Database (React Website)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This website utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to provide users information on the original 151 (Generation 1) Pokemon.

#### Features
1. A list view: users can input a query into a search bar and the app returns a list of results that match the query. The results can also be sorted the based on different properties of the results. The search bar also filters as you type.

2. A gallery view: that displays all the Pokemon requested from the API. The gallery view also has filtering where users can select the type of Pokemon and the gallery only displays results that match the filter.

3. A detail view: When an item in the search view or the gallery view is clicked, the app displays the different attributes of the selected Pokemon. This view has previous and next buttons that lets the user cycle through the list of objects. This view has a specific route when navigated to (i.e. a user can  access the detail route through a specific url.
